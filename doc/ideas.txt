----------------- New Ideas --------------------

- make the paths work with wet soil
- make that walking over path consume less energy
- add a hoe to turn the sediment into agricultural soil?
- update the modules.txt file to include the new modules or merge new mods with existing ones
- make meats and cooked food compostable
- add infotext to pots
- wiha fermentation process:
	- crush wiha to get wiha mash
	- mix wiha mash with water to get wiha must
	- process on the alembic the wiha must to get sugar and wiha dregs.
	- add mushroom sportes to the wiha must to create unfermente wiha cider
	- ferment the wiha cider
	- distill the fermented wiha cider in the alembic to get wiha vinegar
- improve working spaces:
	- pottery wheel from Limestone block and sticks as improved version of the clay shaping spot
	- ceramic idol, improved praying station (better chances)
	- add workbench as improved version of the crafting spot
	- threshing sledge as improved seed extractor.
- improve cooking, bring some benefits to making soup (depending on amount of ingredients?)
- add salt and sugar as cooking ingredient
- add more behaivor driven traits:
	- food related (add a counter each time a food is ingested):
		Vegetarian (after 5 days eating mostly plants)
		Omnivore (if the amount of eaten plants and meat are similar)
		Carnivore (after 5 days eating mostly meat)
		Vegan (after 10 days eating only plants)
		Ascetic (after 5 days without eating)
	- effects based (add a counter of each time the player got the effect):
		Alcoholic (after getting drunk 20% or more of the days)
		Sober (after 10 days without getting drunk any time)
		Metabolism Enhanceer (after getting High on Stimulants 5 times)
		Stimulant Junkie (after using stimulants more than 5% of the days)
		Parasite Resistant (after successfully treating 3 cases of intestinal parasites)
		Iron Stomach (after recovering from food poisoning 5 times)
		Liver of Steel (after surviving hepatotoxicity)
		Hardcore Partier (after recovering from a hangover 5 times)
		Fungal Fighter (after successfully treating 3 cases of fungal infections)
		Sandstorm Nomad (after recovering from Dust Fever 5 times)
		Brain Brawler (after surviving neurotoxicity 3 times)

- add a refrigerator that runs on snow
- use salt, sugar and vinegar to preserve food
- fix translation templates to include all the actual strings
- redesign the runes of painting kits
- add a basalt hammer as alternative club
- make the basalt hammer be required to create the hammering log
- alternatice hammering log with granite
- extract sulfur from volcanic ashes
- alchemy processes: calcination, distillation, dissolution, fermentation, filtration.
- make the smelter probe work with glass
- add more randomness, probabilities
- give boost based on traits

- add books or tablets on the under ground city with recipes for alchemy
- add a container that has to be broken to be opened with common lot on the under ground city
- a easier way to get large amounts of alcohol, maybe from sugar

--------------- Already done -------------------

- add more traits
- roof ridge tiles for uneven roof shapes
- make paths with the digging stick
- add alcohol extraction to the alembic (from tang)

------------ Inhereit form Exile ----------------

Acquired character traits (see each life becomes meaningfully unique)

Pottery wheel and more sophisticated glazed pottery.

Scythe

Right-click to turn torches/lamps off (+require lighting them like with fires)

Degradation of perishable building materials (e.g. mudbrick -> clay, log -> rotten). Gives an advantage to sophisticated building materials.

More-sophisticated medicines, e.g. needing a apothecary kit, can heal for toxins.

Glassware (windows, bottles, distillery, solar still).

Chair (small bed rest effect, but better for crafting).

Cooking: bulk cooking method (cauldron - add food and water to it, take out by bowlful)

Death screen — name and days survived (also put in Breaktaker, maybe a Highscores page?). 

Artifacts (loot): scuba, tree grower.

Dangerous “pandora’s box” loot.

More `megamorph` biomes: gardens, waste dumps, public baths, transporter room, laboratory, storage dumps, factories.

Searching through the junk of a people who destroyed themselves should also be a dubious/bad idea.

More mobs: land predator, and more of everything in general, leather.

Effects currently handled by low-thirst/hunger/low-body-temp/etc., could be turned into effects (e.g. malnutrition, hypothermia).

Food decay.

Punch with torch for firelighter?

Easy start option (start with axe, bag, clothes, water pot, mattress, food).

Dynamism and decoration for underground city.

Some items need inventory images with space around edges (e.g. wattle).

`Character` tab (lore) might need a scroll bar.
