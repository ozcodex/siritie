	- crush wiha to get wiha mash
	- mix wiha mash with water to get wiha must
	- process on the alembic the wiha must to get sugar and wiha dregs.
	- add mushroom sportes to the wiha must to create unfermente wiha cider
	- ferment the wiha cider
	- distill the fermented wiha cider in the alembic to get wiha vinegar
