------------ Inhereit form Exile ----------------

Acquired character traits (see each life becomes meaningfully unique)

Pottery wheel and more sophisticated glazed pottery.

Scythe

Right-click to turn torches/lamps off (+require lighting them like with fires)

Degradation of perishable building materials (e.g. mudbrick -> clay, log -> rotten). Gives an advantage to sophisticated building materials.

More-sophisticated medicines, e.g. needing a apothecary kit, can heal for toxins.

Glassware (windows, bottles, distillery, solar still).

Chair (small bed rest effect, but better for crafting).

Cooking: bulk cooking method (cauldron - add food and water to it, take out by bowlful)

Death screen — name and days survived (also put in Breaktaker, maybe a Highscores page?). 

Artifacts (loot): scuba, tree grower.

Dangerous “pandora’s box” loot.

More `megamorph` biomes: gardens, waste dumps, public baths, transporter room, laboratory, storage dumps, factories.

Searching through the junk of a people who destroyed themselves should also be a dubious/bad idea.

More mobs: land predator, and more of everything in general, leather.

Effects currently handled by low-thirst/hunger/low-body-temp/etc., could be turned into effects (e.g. malnutrition, hypothermia).

Food decay.

Punch with torch for firelighter?

Dynamism and decoration for underground city.

Some items need inventory images with space around edges (e.g. wattle).

`Character` tab (lore) might need a scroll bar.
