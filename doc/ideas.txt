- wiha fermentation process:
	- crush wiha to get wiha mash

	- ceramic idol, improved praying station (better chances? pray more than once?)
	- add workbench as improved version of the crafting spot
	- threshing sledge as improved seed extractor.
- add more behaivor driven traits:

		Vegetarian (after 5 days eating mostly plants)
		Omnivore (if the amount of eaten plants and meat are similar)
		Carnivore (after 5 days eating mostly meat)
		Vegan (after 10 days eating only plants)
		Ascetic (after 5 days without eating)
	- effects based (add a counter of each time the player got the effect):
		Alcoholic (after getting drunk 20% or more of the days)
		Sober (after 10 days without getting drunk any time)
		Metabolism Enhanceer (after getting High on Stimulants 5 times)
		Stimulant Junkie (after using stimulants more than 5% of the days)

- aluminium water containers
- aluminium roof tiles
- aluminium windows 


--------------- Already done -------------------

------------ Inhereit form Exile ----------------

Acquired character traits (see each life becomes meaningfully unique)

Pottery wheel and more sophisticated glazed pottery.

Scythe

Right-click to turn torches/lamps off (+require lighting them like with fires)

Degradation of perishable building materials (e.g. mudbrick -> clay, log -> rotten). Gives an advantage to sophisticated building materials.

More-sophisticated medicines, e.g. needing a apothecary kit, can heal for toxins.

Glassware (windows, bottles, distillery, solar still).

Chair (small bed rest effect, but better for crafting).

Cooking: bulk cooking method (cauldron - add food and water to it, take out by bowlful)

Death screen — name and days survived (also put in Breaktaker, maybe a Highscores page?). 

Artifacts (loot): scuba, tree grower.

Dangerous “pandora’s box” loot.

More `megamorph` biomes: gardens, waste dumps, public baths, transporter room, laboratory, storage dumps, factories.

Searching through the junk of a people who destroyed themselves should also be a dubious/bad idea.

More mobs: land predator, and more of everything in general, leather.

Effects currently handled by low-thirst/hunger/low-body-temp/etc., could be turned into effects (e.g. malnutrition, hypothermia).

Food decay.

Punch with torch for firelighter?

Easy start option (start with axe, bag, clothes, water pot, mattress, food).

Dynamism and decoration for underground city.

Some items need inventory images with space around edges (e.g. wattle).

`Character` tab (lore) might need a scroll bar.
