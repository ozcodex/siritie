---------------- Upcomming --------------------

- make meats, soup and cooked food compostable
- make the composter use the group value as generated compost
- make able to eat mashed whiha

----------------- New Ideas --------------------

	- add workbench as improved version of the crafting spot
	- threshing sledge as improved seed extractor.
	- alternative hammering log with granite
- add more behaivor driven traits:
	- food related (add a counter each time a food is ingested):
		Vegetarian (after 5 days eating mostly plants)
		Omnivore (if the amount of eaten plants and meat are similar)
		Carnivore (after 5 days eating mostly meat)
		Vegan (after 10 days eating only plants)
		Ascetic (after 5 days without eating)
	- effects based (add a counter of each time the player got the effect):
		Alcoholic (after getting drunk 20% or more of the days)
		Sober (after 10 days without getting drunk any time)
		Metabolism Enhanceer (after getting High on Stimulants 5 times)
		Stimulant Junkie (after using stimulants more than 5% of the days)
		Parasite Resistant (after successfully treating 3 cases of intestinal parasites)
		Iron Stomach (after recovering from food poisoning 5 times)
		Liver of Steel (after surviving hepatotoxicity)
		Hardcore Partier (after recovering from a hangover 5 times)
		Fungal Fighter (after successfully treating 3 cases of fungal infections)
		Sandstorm Nomad (after recovering from Dust Fever 5 times)
		Brain Brawler (after surviving neurotoxicity 3 times)
		Sun Shield (after surviving photosensitivity 5 times)

	- add salt (reduce thrist but enhances hunger, too much causes negative effects) as cooking condiment
	- add sugar(energy booster) as cooking condiment
- improvement on tech module:
	- draw a whole tech map tree including future changes
	- refactor the remaining files

- add more blessings and curses with effects to the health
- give boost based on traits
- create a clay smoker for safe bulk cooking
- add charcoal powder as medicine
- fix translation templates to include all the actual strings
- add an api to lower blocks node box if they are on top of a slab
- redesign the runes of painting kits
- add a basalt hammer as alternative club
- make the basalt hammer be required to create the hammering log

- add debug tool: meta reader
- make the paths work with wet soil
- make that walking over path consume less energy
- add a hoe to turn the sediment into agricultural soil?


--------------- Already done -------------------

- add more traits
- roof ridge tiles for uneven roof shapes
- make paths with the digging stick
- add alcohol extraction to the alembic (from tang)
- wiha fermentation process, sugar and vinegar

------------ Inhereit form Exile ----------------

Acquired character traits (see each life becomes meaningfully unique)

Pottery wheel and more sophisticated glazed pottery.

Scythe

Right-click to turn torches/lamps off (+require lighting them like with fires)

Degradation of perishable building materials (e.g. mudbrick -> clay, log -> rotten). Gives an advantage to sophisticated building materials.

More-sophisticated medicines, e.g. needing a apothecary kit, can heal for toxins.

Glassware (windows, bottles, distillery, solar still).

Chair (small bed rest effect, but better for crafting).

Cooking: bulk cooking method (cauldron - add food and water to it, take out by bowlful)

Death screen — name and days survived (also put in Breaktaker, maybe a Highscores page?). 

Artifacts (loot): scuba, tree grower.

Dangerous “pandora’s box” loot.

More `megamorph` biomes: gardens, waste dumps, public baths, transporter room, laboratory, storage dumps, factories.

Searching through the junk of a people who destroyed themselves should also be a dubious/bad idea.

More mobs: land predator, and more of everything in general, leather.

Effects currently handled by low-thirst/hunger/low-body-temp/etc., could be turned into effects (e.g. malnutrition, hypothermia).

Food decay.

Punch with torch for firelighter?

Easy start option (start with axe, bag, clothes, water pot, mattress, food).

Dynamism and decoration for underground city.

Some items need inventory images with space around edges (e.g. wattle).

`Character` tab (lore) might need a scroll bar.
