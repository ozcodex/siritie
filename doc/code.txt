Code lineaments:

Each mod should have 4 folders or files:
	- common for the code that is shared through the nodes or items
	- items for the declaration of the items of the mod
	- crafts for the recipes to crafting nodes and items
	- nodes for the creation of nodes, this include the calls to gereation functions

if the previous are folders, inside the files should have a descriptive name of the type or the category of the nodes/items declared.

The nodeboxes should be declared at the beggining of the nodes file.

The textures folder should be divided into folders if there are more than one type of node/item, and the textures should have a descriptive name.

Whenever is possible call default actions (on_dig, on_right_click, on_construct, etc...) from the minimal mod.

Infotext always should be setted through the functions in minimal mod.
