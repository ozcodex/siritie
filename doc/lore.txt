Siritie Lore:

The character has been exiled to a desolate and secluded land as punishment for their crimes. As they struggle to survive, the mysteries of this land slowly unravel before them. The surface appears devoid of human life, with only a limited variety of plants and small creatures like insects, fish, and birds.

Beneath the earth's surface lies a vast, ancient complex of cities and tunnels. These subterranean structures, although magnificent, now stand empty and abandoned. The previous inhabitants of this land brought about their own extinction, leaving behind only ruins and remnants of their existence.

The scarcity of life on the surface is a consequence of the actions of these extinct people. Many animal species were driven to extinction by their hands, and numerous plant species were destroyed due to selective farming and other factors.

Minerals are also scarce, particularly tin and copper. The previous inhabitants depleted these resources in order to construct machinery and mechanical beings such as automatons and robots. Only iron remains accessible on the surface, but it is a challenging material to work with. The presence of iron can be attributed to the rusted remains of an even older civilization.

The underground holds hidden knowledge of alchemy, shrouded in a cryptic language that must be deciphered. Chests containing valuable items are locked, requiring the discovery of keys or the solution of puzzles and riddles to open them. Additionally, there are ceramic urns that can be shattered to reveal their contents.

Diaries and newspapers provide glimpses into the downfall of this society, chronicling its descent from a prosperous and advanced civilization into corruption, authoritarianism, and an environmental crisis. Eventually, the surviving members were forced to seek refuge underground. They learned to harness alchemy for sustenance, but their knowledge of working with iron was lost, leading to a primitive society that relies solely on the remnants of their ancestors. Repairing anything that breaks is nearly impossible, as the society used or destroyed everything until almost nothing remained.

Scattered throughout the ruins, the protagonist finds remnants of the extinct society's culture and history. These fragments include artwork, music, literature, and rituals that provide glimpses into their way of life. Collecting and deciphering these remnants gradually unveils a richer understanding of the lost civilization.

Deep within the labyrinthine underground complex, the protagonist's path intersects with prophecies and cryptic inscriptions, each detailing the cataclysms that befell the society. These ancient texts speak of a destined hero, a chosen one who possesses the power to restore harmony to the world. This fabled figure is said to wield the ability to revive forgotten technologies, unveil the enigmatic mysteries of the past, and breathe life back into the desolate realm.
