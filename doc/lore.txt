This are some ideas about the lore of the game:

The character is banished to a remote land to die for the crimes they have commited. After surviving the story of this land will be slowlyrevealed, in the surface there are no trace of human being living here, there are no a big variety of plants and only few animals mainly insects, fishes and small birds.

deep under the ground there are a gigantic complex of cities and tunnels but all seems empty and very antique. the previous inhabitants of this land went extint by they our hand, and the lefts  are only the garbage and ruins left behind.

this is the reason of the shortage of variety in the living beings in the surface, a lot of animals where extint by the hand of this people, also a lot of plant species were destroyed because of  selective farming and other causes.

the minerals in the surface are also scase, specially tin and copper, since all where used by that people to create its machinery and mechanical beings (automats, robots), only iron can be found in the surface but is hard to work with this material. the reason because iron is found in the surface is because it's formed from the rusted ruins of even more antique civilization.

there are alchemy knowledge hidden in the undergrund, behind a criptic language that has tobe decoded, the chests are locked and keys need tobe found in order to open them, or they can be picked solving some puzzles and riddles. but there are also ceramic urns that can be broken to get to its contents.

there are diaries and newspapers that will tell how the society slowly meet its own destruction.

timeline of events: starting in a florecent society, how machines were discovered and every thing changed, then a industrial boom whit money flowing and prosperity, after that a crash trat driven the society to corruption and authoritarism, the enviroomental crisis the destruction of the fauna and flora, at this point the society had to find refugee underground, then learn about alchemy used that to grow its own food, the society forgot how to use iron, primitive society that only uses what left behind by they antecesors, if something gets broken is impossible to  repair, the society used or destroyed everything until almost nothing was left behind.
