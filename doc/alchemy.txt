Extra ideas:

extract quartz powder from gneiss
heat up jade boulder to crack it, then hammer it to a chance of getting a jade gem
or crack it with the hammer first and then heat it up for a chance of getting a jade gem

Creating Elixir of Life from quartz powder and gunpowder, calcinated Star Dust, vitriol as solvent, and jade as catalyst.

thermite: iron oxide + aluminum mix, helps to melt things in an Athanor

aqua regia: vitriol + saltpeter

add new disseases: heavy metals poisoning, asbestosis, chemical burns

Potassium permanganate and glycerin to start temite?
 Al+S mix as a starter (maybe mixed with a bit of gunpowder to make a sparkler?)

extract oil form maraka nuts or from certain wood (Oil of terebinth?)

amonia from vermicompost, potash and water using zeolites as catalyst

alchemical super fertilizer saltpeter+ amonia

alcohol + vinegar + coal + salt + vitriol + amonia = ether (cure-all sulfa drug)



Bezoar
    A quasi-legendary stone with universal curative properties found in the bodies of certain animals. The name is occasionally transferred analogically to other medicinal substances, such as Bezoardicum minerale (mineral bezoar, a precipitate of antimony pentoxide produced by the action of aqua fortis on butter of antimony).


Calcanthum
    The residue produced by strongly roasting blue vitriol (copper sulfate); it is composed mostly of copper oxide.


Chrysopoeia
    The transmutation of baser metals into gold.


glaure Augurelli
    Identity is uncertain, although it has been variously identified as a component of gold

Regulus
    The metallic component refined from an ore. Most often applied by Newton and other chymists to metallic antimony or alloys thereof.


Spagyria
    A branch of chymistry concerned with the separation of compound bodies into their constituents and their recombination, generally with an eye toward their medicinal use.
