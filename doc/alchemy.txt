Processes:

calcination, distillation, dissolution, fermentation, mixing.

Code Names:

Osidian: Nightstone
Olivine: Peridot
Sulfur: Brimstone
Zeolites: Nephritic Stone
Sulfuric Acid: Vitriol
Alumina: Star Dust
Potassium Carbonate: Tartar Salt
Potassium Nitrate: Saltpeter
Gunpowder: Serpentine
Caustic Slurry: Acrimoniac
Caustic Soda: Death Salt
Feldspar: Aurifex

Recipes:

* Tang (Distillation) produces alcohol, that is used as fuel in the alchemical process.
* Salt Water (Distillation) produces Salt, that is used as ingredient.
* Slurry (Distilation) produces Caustic Soda, as ingredient
* Aluminum mix (Melting) produces Aluminum, as a new metal

* Basalt + Water produces Obsidian, that can be used as catalyst
* Crushed Basalt + Sulfuric Acid produces Olivine, that can be used as catalyst
* Roasted Iron Powder + Pulverized Volcanic Ash + Zeolites produces sulfur, as ingredient.
* Pulverized Volcanic Ash + Potash + Obsidian produces zeolites, a catalyst.
* Sulfur  + Vinegar + Iron produces Sulfuric Acid, an ingredient
* Clay + Sulfuric Acid produces Alumina, as ingredient
* Wet Clay + Sulfuric Acid produces Potassium Nitrate, as ingredient
* Potash + Water + Limestone produces Potassium Carbonate, as ingredient
* Potassium  + Sulfur + Pulverized Charcoal + Sugar produces Gunpowder
* Pulverized charcoal + Vinegar produces Activated carbon
* Salt + Quicklime + Water + Obsidian produces Slurry
* Vegetable Oil + Caustic Soda produces Soap, can be used to cleaning
* Alumina + Carbon produces Aluminum mix

Extra ideas:

extract quartz powder from gneiss
heat up jade boulder to crack it, then hammer it to a chance of getting a jade gem

Creating Elixir of Life from quartz powder and gunpowder, calcinated Star Dust, vitriol as solvent, and jade as catalyst.


add new disseases: heavy metals poisoning, asbestosis, chemical burns

amonia from vermicompost, potash and water using zeolites as catalyst

alchemical super fertilizer saltpeter+ amonia

alcohol + vinegar + coal + salt + vitriol + amonia = ether (cure-all sulfa drug)


-- Even more crazy ideas (gold?) --

thermite: iron oxide + aluminum mix, helps to melt gold in an Athanor

Potassium permanganate and glycerin to start temite?
 Al+S mix as a starter (maybe mixed with a bit of gunpowder to make a sparkler?)

aqua regia: vitriol + saltpeter with jade as catalyst 

the gold will be extracted (traces) from aurifex powder using aqua regia

Chrysopoeia
    The transmutation of baser metals into gold.

glaure Augurelli
    Identity is uncertain, although it has been variously identified as a component of gold
