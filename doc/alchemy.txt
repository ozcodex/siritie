Extra ideas:

extract quartz powder from gneiss
heat up jade boulder to crack it, then hammer it to a chance of getting a jade gem

Creating Elixir of Life from quartz powder and gunpowder, calcinated Star Dust, vitriol as solvent, and jade as catalyst.


add new disseases: heavy metals poisoning, asbestosis, chemical burns

amonia from vermicompost, potash and water using zeolites as catalyst

alchemical super fertilizer saltpeter+ amonia

alcohol + vinegar + coal + salt + vitriol + amonia = ether (cure-all sulfa drug)


-- Even more crazy ideas (gold?) --

thermite: iron oxide + aluminum mix, helps to melt gold in an Athanor

Potassium permanganate and glycerin to start temite?
 Al+S mix as a starter (maybe mixed with a bit of gunpowder to make a sparkler?)

aqua regia: vitriol + saltpeter with jade as catalyst 

the gold will be extracted (traces) from aurifex powder using aqua regia

Chrysopoeia
    The transmutation of baser metals into gold.

glaure Augurelli
    Identity is uncertain, although it has been variously identified as a component of gold
