@1 Effigy=
You offer up a prayer to your god=
and nothing happens=
You have already said your prayers for today=
and you feel refreshed=
you feel how your faith is strengthened=
something inside you tells you that this is not working=
and you feel a soft breeze that comforts you=
a voice inside you tells you that god is dead, but you decide to ignore it=
