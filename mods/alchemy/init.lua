The alembic is a device used to distill products from liquids stored in clay
pots. It can operate at temperatures higher than the given temperature
(default = 100Â°C), but it can also work at ambient temperature, taking much
longer (default = 300 seconds, 5 minutes).

Each process involves a source, which is the clay pot located under the alembic.
The process takes a specific amount of time and produces a certain number of
products, leaving the subproduct in the clay pot. A single process can produce
multiple products, but only one subproduct.

If there isn't enough space in the alembic's inventory, any additional products
will be lost. The alembic has a set number of inventory slots (default = 4) and
doesn't have a GUI. Products can be retrieved by right-clicking the alembic or
by removing it.
