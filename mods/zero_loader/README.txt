Exile mod: Zero Loader
========================
Zero Loader, load entire folders. helps with mod internal structure.

takes a name i.e. "nodes" and try to load nodes.lua, then tries to load
the folder nodes.lua and all its content. with this is easier to hace a fixed
structure of mods to make them easier to maintain.
