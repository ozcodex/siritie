You offer up a prayer to your god=
and nothing happens=
You have already said your prayers for today=
and you feel refreshed=
you feel how your faith is strengthened=
something inside you tells you that this is not working=
and you feel a soft breeze that comforts you=
a voice inside you tells you that god is dead, but you decide to ignore it=
you feel a cool breeze and a sense of calmness wash over you=
you see a shooting star in the sky and make a wish=
you feel that the Force is with=
you see a dark cloud passing over you, and it feels like a bad omen=
and you hear a mocking laughter in your mind=
you hear a voice saying: You are not worthy of my attention=
and you start to doubt your faith=
you sense a feeling of emptiness and despair wash over you=
